            <p> Hobbies I enjoy are writing, math, and swimming, but my favorite thing to do is crafts. I like to make miniature places like mini campsites out of paper, glue, string, and mini origami-like cranes and other animals. Crafting is very enjoyable
                for me because I make things that I can be proud of. Also, you can have fun by thinking of what to make and while you are making it.I get ideas from the places I go and what I look at. I really enjoy crafting because it is very fun, and
                I feel satisfied when I am finished. Another reason I love to craft is because once I am done, it feels great to see what I have accomplished and what I like about it. This is why I like to craft.<br> ______________________________________________________________________
